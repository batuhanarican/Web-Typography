1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,500
Cooper there's no point using your fuel to chase...

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,540
Analyze the Endurance's spin.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,496
Cooper what are you doing?

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,260
Docking.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Endurance's rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,640
Ok, get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,040
It's not possible.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,960
No, it's necessary.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,000
Endurance is hitting stratosphere.

10
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:57,574
She's got no heat shield.

11
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:02,209
CASE you ready?

12
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:02,994
Ready!

13
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:13,995
Cooper this is no time for caution!

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,220
CASE if I black out you take the stick.

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,480
TARS you ready to engage the docking mechanism?

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,060
Endurance is starting to heat.

17
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,300
20 feet up.

18
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,154
10 feet up.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,240
Cooper we are... lined up.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,256
Initiating spin.

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
Come on TARS.

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,760
Come on TARS.

23
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,310
We are locked.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,640
Easen up!

25
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,694
Easy.

26
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,860
Easy.

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
Retro thrusters.

28
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,855
Main engines on.

29
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,374
Pushing out of orbit.

30
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,920
Come on baby.

31
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,115
Killing main engines.

32
00:03:34,740 --> 00:00:00,000
Ok, we're out of orbit.
